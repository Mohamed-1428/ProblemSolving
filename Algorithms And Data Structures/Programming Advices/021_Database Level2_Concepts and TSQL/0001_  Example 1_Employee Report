select * from departments;
select * from employees;

------------- Solution


-- Step 1: Declare variables
DECLARE @DepartmentID INT; -- Variable for department ID
DECLARE @StartDate DATE; -- Variable for start date
DECLARE @EndDate DATE; -- Variable for end date
DECLARE @TotalEmployees INT; -- Variable to hold the total number of employees
DECLARE @DepartmentName VARCHAR(50); -- Variable for department name

-- Step 2: Initialize variables
SET @DepartmentID = 3; -- Assign a specific department ID
SET @StartDate = '2023-01-01'; -- Set start date for the report
SET @EndDate = '2023-12-31'; -- Set end date for the report

select @DepartmentName = Name from departments where DepartmentID = @DepartmentID;
select @TotalEmployees = count(*) from Employees where departmentid = @DepartmentID AND HireDate BETWEEN @StartDate AND @EndDate;

-- Step 5: Print the report
PRINT 'Department Report';
PRINT 'Department Name: ' + @DepartmentName;
PRINT 'Reporting Period: ' + CAST(@StartDate AS VARCHAR) + ' to ' + CAST(@EndDate AS VARCHAR);
PRINT 'Total Employees Hired in ' + CAST(YEAR(@StartDate) AS VARCHAR) + ': ' + CAST(@TotalEmployees AS VARCHAR);
