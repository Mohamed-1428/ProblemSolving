select * from EmployeeAttendance;
---------- My Solution ------------

-- Declare variables
DECLARE @ReportMonth INT;
DECLARE @ReportYear INT;
DECLARE @TotalDays INT;
DECLARE @EmployeeID INT;
DECLARE @PresentDays INT;
DECLARE @AbsentDays INT;
DECLARE @LeaveDays INT;

-- Initialize variables
SET @ReportMonth = 7; -- Set the month for the report
SET @ReportYear = 2023; -- Set the year for the report
SET @EmployeeID = 101; -- Set the Employee ID for the report
select @TotalDays = count(*) from EmployeeAttendance where EmployeeID= @EmployeeID and YEAR(AttendanceDate) = @ReportYear AND MONTH(AttendanceDate) = @ReportMonth;
select @PresentDays = count(*) from EmployeeAttendance where EmployeeID = @EmployeeID and YEAR(AttendanceDate) = @ReportYear AND MONTH(AttendanceDate) = @ReportMonth and Status = 'Present';
select @AbsentDays = count(*) from EmployeeAttendance where EmployeeID = @EmployeeID and YEAR(AttendanceDate) = @ReportYear AND MONTH(AttendanceDate) = @ReportMonth and Status = 'Absent';
select @LeaveDays = count(*) from EmployeeAttendance where EmployeeID = @EmployeeID and YEAR(AttendanceDate) = @ReportYear AND MONTH(AttendanceDate) = @ReportMonth and Status = 'Leave';

-- Print the report
PRINT 'Employee Attendance Report for Employee ID: ' + CAST(@EmployeeID AS VARCHAR);
PRINT 'Report Month: ' + CAST(@ReportMonth AS VARCHAR) + '/' + CAST(@ReportYear AS VARCHAR);
PRINT 'Total Working Days: ' + CAST(@TotalDays AS VARCHAR);
PRINT 'Days Present: ' + CAST(@PresentDays AS VARCHAR);
PRINT 'Days Absent: ' + CAST(@AbsentDays AS VARCHAR);
PRINT 'Days on Leave: ' + CAST(@LeaveDays AS VARCHAR);
