Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

We pleased to inform you that we have successfully completed Sprint 4 of the Telemarketing System Project. Below is a summary of the key deliverables achieved during this sprint:

Analyzing Productivity Report: The system now includes a comprehensive productivity report to evaluate telemarketers’ performance effectively.

Tracking Telemarketers’ Activity: We've implemented functionality to track telemarketers' daily activities, providing greater transparency and accountability.

Building Projects Dictionaries: We have developed project-specific dictionaries to assist Admins with marking and categorization tasks.

Project Evaluation Module: The evaluation system has been built to assess project status and telemarketer contributions.

Project Expected Remaining Days: The system now estimates the remaining days for project completion based on current progress metrics and Telemarketers behaviors.

These features are designed to enhance operational efficiency and contribute to the project's overall success.

Additionally, we are pleased to inform you that the system is now ready for User Acceptance Testing (UAT). You may begin testing the system to ensure that all functionalities meet your requirements.
Please let me know if you have any feedback or questions regarding the completed tasks, or if there are any issues during the UAT process.

Best regards,
