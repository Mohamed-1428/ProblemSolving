Dear Team,

Thanks to Technical Data Analysis team, in cooperation with Syriatel technical experts, I am pleased to announce the launch of our latest innovation: Technical Performance Platform with its second sprint “Creating KPIs”.

Technical Performance Platform

The introduction of the Technical Performance Platform marks a significant milestone as the first multi-tenancy system that correlates all network elements’ indicators. This innovative platform revolutionizes our approach to network performance monitoring by offering users the unprecedented ability to access and analyze multiple network elements according to their specific requirements. By consolidating data from disparate sources into a unified interface, the platform serves as a single source of truth, enabling users to seamlessly combine and correlate information about overall network performance. This capability not only streamlines operations but also empowers stakeholders with comprehensive insights, fostering informed decision-making and proactive management strategies. The Technical Performance Platform represents a paradigm shift in our approach to network monitoring, setting a new standard for efficiency, reliability, and scalability within our organization.
